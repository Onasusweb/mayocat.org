<h2>Why another e-commerce platform ?</h2>

<p>
    We're building Mayocat Shop out of two observations: the lack of a simple solution for small businesses
    who want to start an e-commerce site, and the advent of online marketplaces that bring together such actors in
    curated
    websites.
</p>

<p>
    Indeed, the landscape of e-commerce open source software is dominated by complex solutions that meet the needs of
    actors with complex catalog, logistics and workflow needs. <br>
    Small businesses wishing to sell their products through a simple e-commerce sites are turning to the world of
    hosted software (SaaS), and their possibilities for customization and expansion are limited.<br>
    Meanwhile, online marketplaces are democratizing and allow to unite around a brand or theme, e-merchants wishing
    to extend their reach without incurring marketing action. <br>
    <strong>The Mayocat Shop open source software meets both the need for simplicity in managing small e-commerce
        businesses,
        and provides tools to connect them together through online marketplaces.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
    The feature-set offered by Mayocat is not too broad to keep the promise of simplified e-commerce. However, the
    platform is easily extensible via a plugin mechanism to accommodate special needs. <br>
    Among the basics features of e-commerce Mayocat Shop offers, we find:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>product management</li>
    <li>simple inventory management</li>
    <li>shipping management (geographical areas, shipping methods)</li>
    <li>order management</li>
    <li>CMS functionalities (pages, news, management attached parts)</li>
    <li>internationalization management</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The marketplace features allow to create and maintain many e-commerces shops on the same platform,
    and adds in the means to connect them together in a unified interface via its APIs: lists and cross-shop research of
    products, shared cart, etc...
