<h2>Mayocat Shop</h2>

<p>
    Mayocat Shop is born out of two observations : the lack of a simple solution for small businesses who want to
    start an e-commerce site, and the advent of online marketplaces that bring together such actors in curated
    websites.
</p>

<p>
    Indeed, the landscape of e-commerce open source software is dominated by complex solutions that meet the needs
    of actors with complex catalog, logistics and workflow needs. <br>
    Small businesses wishing to sell their products through a simple e-commerce sites are turning to the world of
    hosted software (SaaS), and their possibilities for customization and expansion are limited.<br>
    Meanwhile, marketplaces democratize and allow to unite around a brand or theme, e-merchant wishing to extend
    their broadcasts without incurring marketing action. <br><!-- FIXME vague -->
    <strong>Mayocat open source software meets both the need for simplicity in managing small e-commerce businesses,
        and provides tools to connect them together through online marketplaces.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The feature-set offered by Mayocat is not too broad to keep the promise of simplified e-commerce. However, the
    platform is easily extensible via a plugin mechanism to accommodate special needs. <br>
    Among the basics features of e-commerce Mayocat Shop offers, we find:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>product management</li>
    <li>simple inventory management</li>
    <li>shipping management (geographical areas, shipping methods)</li>
    <li>order management</li>
    <li>CMS functionalities (pages , news, management attached parts )</li>
    <li>internationalization management</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The marketplace features allow to create and maintain strong e-commerces shops, as well as the programming
    interface for the development : lists and cross-shop research of products, shared cart, etc...
</p>

<p>
    Mayocat is based on the Java platform, and uses modern open source technologies : Java 1.7, ElasticSearch,
    PostgreSQL, Jersey, Jetty and many more in order to streamline its development and provide the best performance
    and maximum scalability .
