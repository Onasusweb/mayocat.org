Theme localization
==================

Many online shops have customers coming from more than just one region of the world. Localization is the process of accommodating several countries and languages so that no customer is left behind!

Localization in Mayocat Shop is easy and complete: everything, both in the theme and in the shop's data, can be localized.

Localization for shop owners
----------------------------

Before we dive into the actual meat, the localization of themes, let's see what localization means for shop owners.

When setting-up their shop, shop owners choose the languages they want to expose in their storefront. There is a "main" language, often times the language of the country the shop is born in, and "alternatives" languages for accommodating other customers. Here's an excerpt from the dialog in the back-office where shop owners select the languages they want:

Once they've set this up, the shop owners or managers can edit all their content in the languages they've picked: products, content pages, new articles, etc. Here's how it looks like for them, in the back-office:

Localization of the words of the theme
--------------------------------------

Now we've covered what localization means for shop owners, let's dig the localization of themes. As a theme creator, you are expected to facilitate the localization of all the words displayed in your theme that don't come from the shop's data. We call them _words of the theme_. Those can be many things: mentions in the footer, the link to the cart, etc. Basically, any other words and sentences your theme needs!

The actual localization of the words of the theme happens in a folder of your theme named ```localization```. Here you can provide the theme with one file per language it supports. The file themselves are ```.properties``` files with a very simple syntax we cover below. Here is an example of the contents of such a folder for a theme that support English, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Chinese:

![Localization properties files for a theme](/images/theme-localization-files.png "Localization properties files for a theme")

Here's an excerpt of the contents of such files, here for the English language:

    eshop.cart.title=What have you in your basket?
    eshop.cart.numberOfItems=Number of items: {NUMBER_OF_ITEMS}
    eshop.cart.item=You have {QUANTITY, plural, one {1 cheese} other {# cheeses}} of type {CHEESE_NAME} in your basket
    eshop.cart.review=Review order
    eshop.cart.delivery=Delivery details
    eshop.cart.payement=Payment details
    eshop.cart.cart=Cart
    # [...] More words

As you can see, each line is a localization entry, where a ```key``` (a unique id) is matched with a word or a sentence. They are separated by the sign ```=``` ;  on the left of the sign is the ```key ```, and on the right, the word or sentence in the language we are working on.

Then, displaying the sentence for a certain ```key``` in the theme requires you to call a ```{{message}}``` Handlebars's helper, passing it the desired ```key```, like this:

    {{message 'eshop.cart.title'}}

With this, when a user is visiting the english version of the shop, he will read:

    What have you in your basket?

Whereas a user visiting the French version, assuming you have created the matching ```fr.properties``` localization file properly, will read:

    Qu'as-tu donc dans ton panier?

On the second line of the excerpt, you can see the sentence is ```Number of items: {NUMBER_OF_ITEMS}```. Here, with ```{NUMBER_OF_ITEMS}``` we've introduce the notion of a localization ```variable```. Localization variables let translators place dynamic data (here the number of items in the cart) anywhere they want in the localized sentences â€“ that's useful since languages work differently in terms of ordering of sentence constructs. It is customary to define localization variables all WITH_CAPS_LIKE_THIS to identify them  easily.

You pass variables to the ```{{message}}``` helper the following way:

    {{message 'eshop.cart.numberOfItems' NUMBER_OF_ITEMS=cart.numberOfItems}}

Assuming the prospective customer has added 3 items in his cart, he will read:

    Number of items: 3
